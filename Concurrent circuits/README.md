### Concurrent Circuits

Boolean circuits represent Boolean expressions using graphs. For example, the expression
**x ∧ (x ∨ ¬y) ∧ (z ∨ y)**
can be represented as a tree,

or, if we allow operators of higher arity, as a tree as well.

By convention, Boolean computations are usually evaluated from left to right. Thus, in the expression **x ∧ y**, the value of **x** is computed first, and then the value of **y**. The so-called *lazy evaluation* may skip computing parts of subexpressions if the already computed values are sufficient to determine the entire expression’s value. For instance, in the expression **true ∨ x**, the value of **x** does not need to be computed, since the result of the whole expression is already known to be **true**.

Note that if expressions do not produce side effects, then the order of subexpression evaluation should not affect the final value. This means that subexpressions can be evaluated concurrently.

Your task is to implement a program that enables concurrent evaluation of Boolean expressions. The program should allow multiple expressions to be evaluated simultaneously, and individual expressions should be evaluated concurrently as well.

### Boolean Expression

A Boolean expression is defined inductively:

* Constants **true** and **false** are Boolean expressions.
* **NOT a**, the negation of Boolean expression *a*, is a Boolean expression.
* Conjunction **AND(a1, a2, …)** and disjunction **OR(a1, a2, …)** of at least two Boolean expressions are Boolean expressions.
* The conditional **IF(a, b, c)** is a Boolean expression.
* Threshold expressions **GTx(a1, a2, …, an)** and **LTx(a1, a2, …, an)**, where *n ≥ 1* and *x ≥ 0* are integers, are Boolean expressions.

---

### Semantics

For an expression *a*, let [a] denote its value:

* [true] = true
* [false] = false
* [AND(a1, a2, …, an)] = true if every expression ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) satisfies [ai] = true, and false otherwise.
* [OR(a1, a2, …, an)] = true if there exists an expression ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) with [ai] = true, and false otherwise.
* [GTx(a1, a2, …, an)] = true if at least (x + 1) expressions ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) satisfy [ai] = true, and false otherwise.
* [LTx(a1, a2, …, an)] = true if at most (x − 1) expressions ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) satisfy [ai] = true, and false otherwise.
* [IF(a, b, c)] = [b] if [a] = true, and [c] otherwise.

---

### Specification

In the solution, circuits are represented by objects of class `Circuit`, and their values are computed by objects implementing the `CircuitSolver` interface, called *solvers*.

```java
public interface CircuitSolver {
    public CircuitValue solve(Circuit c);
    public void stop();
}
```

where `CircuitValue` has the following interface:

```java
public interface CircuitValue {
    public boolean getValue() throws InterruptedException;
}
```

* The method `solve(Circuit c)` must immediately return a special `CircuitValue` object representing the value of the circuit.
* The value can be retrieved by calling `CircuitValue.getValue()`, which waits until the value is computed.
* Solvers should support concurrent handling of multiple requests (calls to `solve()`) and compute circuit values concurrently whenever possible.

The `stop()` method should:

* Stop accepting new `solve()` requests,
* Immediately terminate all currently running computations of this solver.

From that moment, `CircuitValue` objects corresponding to new or interrupted computations may throw an `InterruptedException` when `getValue()` is called. Other objects should return correctly computed circuit values.

---

### Circuit Representation

The class representing circuits, `Circuit`, and its helper classes are provided in the archive. The interface of `Circuit` looks as follows:

```java
public class Circuit {
    private final CircuitNode root;

    public final CircuitNode getRoot();
}
```

Expressions stored in the `root` field have a tree structure represented by classes containing, among others, the following fields (the full interface is available in the archive from the “Solution” section):

```java
public class CircuitNode {
  private final NodeType type;
  private final CircuitNode[] args;

  public CircuitNode[] getArgs();
  public NodeType getType();
}

public class ThresholdNode extends CircuitNode {
  public int getThreshold();
}

public class LeafNode extends CircuitNode {
  public boolean getValue();
}
```

where `NodeType` is an enum:

```java
public enum NodeType {
  LEAF, GT, LT, AND, OR, NOT, IF
}
```

with the natural interpretation of symbols.

---

### Concurrency: Liveness and Safety

The program should allow multiple concurrent `solve()` calls.

* The results of `solve()` calls should be returned as quickly as possible, and the order of evaluation does not need to match the order of requests.
* Both leaf values and operator values should be computed concurrently.
* In particular, note that calls to `LeafNode.getValue()` and `getArgs()` may take arbitrarily long, but they do not produce side effects and handle interruptions correctly.
* It can be assumed that external interruptions (not caused by your implementation), e.g., `Thread.interrupt()`, will only occur in threads during calls to `CircuitValue.getValue()`.

Additionally:

* Each node in the expression tree is unique,
* Expression trees of different circuits are disjoint,
* Each `solve()` call receives a different `Circuit` instance.
* You may also assume that the `stop()` method will always be called on each created `CircuitSolver` object.

---

### Solution

The solution should be delivered as an archive `ab123456.zip`, where:

* `ab123456` is replaced with the student’s identifier,
* The implementation of the solver is placed in the package `cp2024.solution`.

---

### Formal Requirements

* Submit the solution via Moodle in the appropriate location.
* Files in the package `cp2024.solution` may be modified and additional helper files (e.g., new class definitions) may be added.
* Changes in other packages (directories of the archive) will be ignored.
* Solutions will be run by copying the `*.java` files from `cp2024/solution`. Other changes will be ignored (i.e., do not create subpackages or modify interfaces).
* The solution must compile and run on the machine `students.mimuw.edu.pl` from the `src/` directory using:

```
javac -d ../bin/ cp2024/*/*.java && java --class-path ../bin/ cp2024.demo.Demo
```

(using `cp2024.solution.ParallelCircuitSolver` in `Demo.java`).

* The implementation should not print anything to standard output or error (`System.out` or `System.err`).
* Do not use non-English characters in source files (in particular, no Polish diacritics) except in comments.
* Coding style should be consistent and coherent (e.g., follow the Google Java Style Guide).
* The solution must not use `java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture<T>` or its derivatives.

Any questions or remarks should be posted on the Moodle forum dedicated to this assignment.
